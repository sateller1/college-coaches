      Welcome to the CollegeCoaches.us FAQ section. Here you’ll find answers to common questions about our database, 
      how we gather and update coach contact information, and how to make the most of our tools. 
      If you don’t see your question here, feel free to reach out through our 
      <a href="contact.html">Contact page</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>1. What is CollegeCoaches.us?</h2>
    <p>
      CollegeCoaches.us is an online directory that helps athletes, parents, and recruiters find up-to-date contact 
      information for college coaches across multiple sports and divisions. Our goal is to make the recruiting process easier 
      by providing organized, verified data in one place.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Where does your coach information come from?</h2>
    <p>
      We compile data from publicly available college athletics department websites, conference listings, and official NCAA resources. 
      We also verify and update our information regularly to ensure accuracy.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How often is your database updated?</h2>
    <p>
      We perform major updates several times per year — typically once each season — and smaller updates as needed when staff changes occur. 
      The “Last Updated” date is displayed on each sport’s directory page.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Can I contact coaches directly through your site?</h2>
    <p>
      No. We provide email addresses and contact information, but all communication is handled directly between you and the coach or school. 
      Please use professional, respectful communication when reaching out.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Do I need to pay to use CollegeCoaches.us?</h2>
    <p>
      No, our coach contact directory is free to use. Some additional features or premium tools may be added in the future, 
      but access to basic coach listings will remain free.
    </p>

    <h2>6. How can I report incorrect or outdated information?</h2>
    <p>
      If you notice any outdated coach details, you can send us a message through our 
      <a href="contact.html">Contact page</a> with the correction. We appreciate your help in keeping our listings accurate.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Can I download the coach lists?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes. Each sport page includes download options (usually in CSV format) so you can easily view or organize contact details offline.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Do you have listings for every sport and division?</h2>
    <p>
      We’re continuously expanding our database. Currently, we cover the major NCAA men’s and women’s sports across Divisions I, II, and III. 
      Additional sports and divisions are being added over time.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Is CollegeCoaches.us affiliated with the NCAA?</h2>
    <p>
      No. CollegeCoaches.us is an independent project and is not officially affiliated with or endorsed by the NCAA or any college athletic department.
    </p>

    <h2>10. How can I advertise or partner with you?</h2>
    <p>
      If you’re interested in advertising or partnership opportunities, please contact us via our 
      <a href="contact.html">Contact page</a>.
